# CYP P450 2C9 Inhibition

## Dataset Description: 

The CYP P450 genes are involved in the formation and breakdown (metabolism) of various molecules and chemicals within cells. Specifically, the CYP P450 2C9 plays a major role in the oxidation of both xenobiotic and endogenous compounds.

## Task Description: 

Binary Classification. Given a drug SMILES string, predict CYP2C9 inhibition.

## Dataset Statistics: 

11,934 drugs.
